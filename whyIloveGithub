To show the Gihubbers in charge how ideal I am for the Account Manager position 

I love Github because the sense of community it brings between teams, strangers collaborating on the same project, and between users and Github itself. Github is a company that truly cares about its users and bringing them the best possible experience and this dedication shows. It shows in the enthusiasm of the users, in the posts of the Github blog, in the attention to detail seen throughout the site. 

I also respect and admire Github's commitment to education, which I saw earlier through the educator's discount Github has had for a while and now through education.github.com. Learning to program is difficult, but it's an important skill for kids to have in today's world. Github makes learning and teaching easier, and it's clear that education is a top priority for Github.
