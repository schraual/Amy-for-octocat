To show the Gihubbers in charge how ideal I am for the Account Manager position 

How my skills match Github's account management position: 

- I currently work as a project manager at a software development startup. On a daily basis this role includes: 
   >Building relationships with clients so that I thoroughly understand their website's needs
   >Suggesting ways in which clients can use our company and its services to the fullest extent and get the most out of their experience
   >Upselling bundles we have in place which would be advantageous to the client's site: from SEO work to site speed improvement 
  > Providing technical support via all mediums, from social media and live chat to phone and email - whatever it takes
  >Taking customer feedback and turning it into tangible product improvements 
  >Problem solving ambiguous issues clients don't quite understand themselves
